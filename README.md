# Email-Sender
This website made with Streamlit will allow you to send emails through Gmail with ease! There are two modes to this application (Simple Sender and Mass Sender) which can be accessed through the first dropdown menu of the website. 

## Simple Sender
This mode will allow sonmeone to send an email to just one person. This will require the user to insert the same inputs as gmail to send the email along with an additional app password which can be made through Google Security. 

## Mass Sender
This mode will allow the user to send an email to multiple people all at once. Additional inputs required include a CSV file upload of all the names and emails that the person is sending to formatted in the EXACT way that the shown example is formatted, and an opening with its own punctuation at the end to address the recievers' name in the beginning of the email. The rest of the inputs are about the same as the Simple Sender inputs.
